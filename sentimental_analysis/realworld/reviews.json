{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

So disappointed...I am just thinking save your money go to the laundry mat do it all at once. Wash sit dry sit go home....easier than this was...wait a few minutes....drain...wait...rinse....drain....take out and spin doesn't spin dry like it says by the way.

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Update:I bought this unit the week of Christmas 2019 so it was delivered around the beginning on January, which is when I wrote my initial review. It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find !

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Update:I bought this unit the week of Christmas 2019 so it was delivered around the beginning on January, which is when I wrote my initial review. It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall !

I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Update:I bought this unit the week of Christmas 2019 so it was delivered around the beginning on January, which is when I wrote my initial review. It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Update:I bought this unit the week of Christmas 2019 so it was delivered around the beginning on January, which is when I wrote my initial review. It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty.

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines.

I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket.

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket.

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty.

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines.

I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket.

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door !

The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find !

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find !

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall !

It worked great in terms of cleaning the clothes. There was a bit of a learning curve in terms of using the drain hose and spinner. I didn't have the hose in a place to drain when first using the spinner so water got on the floor.  With that being said I used this product about five times before I plugged it in and it just would not spin in the washer or spinner components. I removed the clothes and tried just turning it on to see what the problem was. It sounds as though the motor died after just 5 times of use.  I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty. Let's see if they honor that and I will update my review as I have more information. I would not but this product again if I knew this information before hand.\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall !

My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Update:I bought this unit the week of Christmas 2019 so it was delivered around the beginning on January, which is when I wrote my initial review. It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window. I will update if the company is helpful.Updated Update: Its now April 16. The company has of ZERO help. I emailed them with my concern. They asked for a video of the sound the machine was making. I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines. I washed a few loads of regular laundry and it cleans very well! I can even fit queen sized sheets in it!\n\n  \n"},

I now have a pile of soapy wet clothes on my bathtub that I will ultimately have to take back to the laundromat. I have contacted the company via email as they have no phone number ( I even called Amazon to verify this) and it states that there is a 3 month warranty.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window.

I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines.

It is now March 13, 2020 and the drain pump has started making noises and draining slowly.  I have contacted the company, but I am doubtful of a resolution since it is past the 30 day return window.

I emailed them back the same day, and also the next day when I hadn't heard back from them and never heard a response.  Now the drain pump has completely gone out, I contacted Amazon since the company never got back to me after the video. Amazon emailed the company on my behalf, and within two hours their customer service emailed me chastising me saying they had already emailed with me before. I said \"yes, until I sent the video you requested\", to which I got the response \"it's been three months, you are not getting a refund\"So long story short, this company will not back up their products, and will provide little to no service if you are having issues. I would recommend to look elsewhere. It's unfortunate because when I first got it I loved it, and did love it-AND RECOMMEND IT, I recommended it to several people. All I have now is a broken washer and regrets.This is such a cute machine. I bought this because I loved the idea of saving water and electricity compared to traditional machines.

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},

It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find !

{"stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "comment": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  I love this machine! If it only dried the clothes I'd be a happy camper!! It works better then my washing machine I had in my stick and brick home. We are now full time in a travel trailer, and I was fed up with campground laundry mats, either to much money for a load of clothes, or dirty machines. This one fits in my kitchen for travel days and can be used at my kitchen sink and a longer hose to drain it out the door, or as I have it now, sitting outside, covered till I need it. I fill it with a hose, much quicker then the faucet, and have a laundry rack for drying my clothes after the spinner basket is done spinning the water out of my clean clothes. It spins the clothes to almost dry , so drying time is minimal after I hang my stuff. My way of using my machine may be different then other reviewers have stated, I fill the washer side with water, add my clothes, do 2 - 15 minute cycles, drain and as the water is draining, I use the hose to rinse the items as I put them over into the spinner, ( I don't spin the clothes, just use the basket to hold the items) after everything is rinsed with the hose, and the washer is empty of water and clothes, I then fill the washer up again, and return the rinsed items back into it, and add my softener. After another 2 cycles of washing, I then spin a few items at a time, after rinsing them off with the hose in the spinner basket. I only use the spinner basket at the end of the wash cycle to extract the water to hang on the drying rack or hangers depending on what the item is.I know it's summer now, but come winter I'll wash inside and drain out the door, ( I winter in Florida, my home state) and will use a laundry mat to dry my clothes. For the price, you can't go wrong, and it takes up very little space, and with help from my husband I can get it in and out of the travel trailer as needed. I think it weighs about 30 lbs, but with the way our entrance way is, it takes 2 of us to get it in the door ! I know I'm happy with mine, so give it a chance, I think you'll be happy with it too!!Edit  3/28/2020  This washer is already broke !! The plastic hinges on the lids are all broke, and I'm using a brick on the spinner basket so I can at least get the clothes to spin.The spinner basket has some kind of safety feature that won't allow the basket to spin if it isn't closed correctly!I'll be looking for a different brand ! To sad it's out of warranty already and would cost to much to send back seeing how the box it came in is long gone ! Shame on the makers of this machine, I'm sure I'm not the only one !!Edit 6/14/20, bought a second one, the reason being it holds more laundry then any others I could find ! Arrived with a crack on the washer side, bottom of the curved wall ! It's been 4 days since I contacted the seller, by email,  no actual phone number, said to give them 48 hours to return message, notta as of today !\n\n  \n"},
