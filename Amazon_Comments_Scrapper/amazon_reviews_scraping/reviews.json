The thumb contours are really well designed and have a soft rubber material. Overall, I'm happy woth the product.What could have been better?1. On/off switch - It's turns on when you press any button and turns off after certain time of inactivity. Probelm is when you keep it in a laptob bag/case, it might turn on due to unintended pressure.2. The back/forward keys could have been customizable for other functions.\n\n  \n"},

It is a really good product and you will love using this mouse. It is very handy and comfortable. Never a glitch and I can use this mouse at very long distance from it's receiver. I believe that is because it connects with receiver through 2.4 GHz wireless tech.If you are looking for something sleek yet functional and which shouldn't hit your wallet a lot, this is the product for you. Go for it\n\n  \n"},

The design and looks are the best and it gives you a complete feel of a gaming mouse. I have been playing a lot of PC games and this mouse is a masterpiece. The extra buttons are like the additional feature of the product. I am really satisfied and happy after buying the product. Finally I got something which I wanted from a long time. Thanks\n\n  \n"},

There were delays in the delivery and times when proper tracking was not available. However, once I opened the product all the frustration due to that went up in smoke. It is quiet ergonomic for me (I have small hands). All one needs to do is just pop in the battery and press any key, and you are set. The sensitivity adjustment also works perfectly.One of the qualms I had was it is not possible to do fine adjustment with it. It does not detect very small movements and hence at times gave some trouble.Other than that, it works perfectly.\n\n  \n"},
